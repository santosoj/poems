There was a colour red
Which only she would use

For only she did know
How this ink was produced

It was from human blood
Which she knew how to draw

And many a lonesome night
She crept into a house

A man, his child, his spouse
Their miserable life

Were given so much worth
As Andouille decides

To turn them into ink
And ink then into art
